It contains Codes and source data for:
1.	Instability analysis of bistable beam
   
	(a) Plot the force-displacement curve and energy curve of a single bistable beam under the given geometric parameters;

	(b) Plot the phase map with respect to amplitude and hinge thickness;

	(c) Compare the force-displacement curves from analytical prediction and finite element simulation.

3.	Parametric study of logic gate

	(a) Generate the mesh information (nodes and elements) of logic gates with different geometric parameters;

	(b)Provide the keyword files (.inp file) of logic gates for FE simulations in ABAQUS/Standard.
